## Work Day Scheduler
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar app that helps you schedule your work day. It uses color-coding to indicate whether each time block is in the past, present, or future. You can click into a time block to enter an event and save it using the save button. The text for each event is saved in local storage, so it persists even if you refresh the page.
## Getting Started
To use the Work Day Scheduler, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar. Scroll down to view the time blocks for the day. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Click into a time block to enter an event and save it using the save button.
## Color-Coding
Color-coding your calendar can help you stay organized and streamline your work day. You can assign a color to each type of task in your calendar, such as blue for invoicing and green for writing. This can help you focus on one type of task at a time and avoid context-switching.
## Saving Events
To save an event, click into a time block and enter the event text. Then click the save button for that time block. The text for that event will be saved in local storage, so it will persist even if you refresh the page.
## Updating the Schedule
To update the schedule, simply edit the index.html file and add more time blocks for each hour of the work day. Each time block should have a unique ID in the format hour-X, where X is the hour in 24-hour format (e.g. 9, 10, 11, etc.). The time blocks should be added in order, starting with 9am and ending with 5pm.
